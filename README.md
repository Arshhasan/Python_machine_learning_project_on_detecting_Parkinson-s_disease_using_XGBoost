Parkinson's Disease Detection using XGBoost


A Python machine learning project to detect Parkinson's disease using XGBoost algorithm.

Project Overview


This project aims to build a machine learning model using XGBoost to detect Parkinson's disease based on various factors. The model is trained on a dataset containing features such as age, sex, and motor symptoms.

Dataset


The dataset used in this project is the Parkinson's Disease Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Features


- Age
- Sex
- Motor symptoms (e.g. tremors, rigidity)
- ... (other features)

Requirements


- Python 3.x
- XGBoost
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy

Installation


To install the required libraries, run the following command:

bash
pip install xgboost scikit-learn pandas numpy


Usage


1. Clone the repository: `git clone 
2. Navigate to the project directory: cd parkinsons-disease-detection
3. Run the Python script: python 

Model Performance


The model achieved an accuracy of 94.87% on the test dataset.
